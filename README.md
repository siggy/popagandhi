popagandhi on hugo and netlify

### About

This repo hosts [Adrianna Tan's](https://popagandhi.com) personal weblog, which has been around in some form since 2003.

This version is a bunch of flat text files inside the `content` folder, the site is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

The theme is [Hugo Ink](https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink) with a custom photos section that I made. You can preview the code for that in [this folder](https://github.com/skinnylatte/pop22/tree/main/themes/hugo-ink/layouts/photos).
